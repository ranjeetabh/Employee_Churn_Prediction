# Employee_Churn_Prediction

This project aims to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition/churn/turnover from a company, i.e gradual loss 
of employees over a period of time. Various contributing factors behind attrition are analyzed. The input files used for this
project are artificially generated (distribution close to real-world data). Multiple datasets are merged to form a single dataset which is used for building the predictive model. The employees most likely to churn from the organization are identified for taking corrective measures. Logistic regression algorithm is used to build the predictive model. Implementation is in R.
